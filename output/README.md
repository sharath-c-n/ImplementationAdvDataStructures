Implementation of Advanced Data Structures
===========================================
Short project 1
------------------------------------------

* Comparing mergeSort with nsquared sort and identifying penalties of using generics in JAVA.

    The main file in SortAlgorithmComparator.java(under cs6301.g26 package)
    and all the logic related to the sorting algorithms are placed in cs6301.g26.sorter package
    there are two files.

            Running the program : Compile the java files and run the SortAlgorithmComparator, this will ask you
            to enter the size of the array on which you want to compare the sort algorithms. Enter the size and the program
            will output the runtime of each algorithms in milliseconds.


* Finding the diameter of a undirected graph

    The main file in GraphMain.java(under cs6301.g26 package).


            Running the program : Compile and run the GraphMain class, this will proved 2 options
            1. enter the graph manually
            2. enter the file which contains the graph details.
            User can choose either one of the choice and provide the graph details. Once all the details are entered
            The program will output the diameter of the input graph.
            Note that all the graph inputs should be in the format expected by the graph class readGraph()
            method.
