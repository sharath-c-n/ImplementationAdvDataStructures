The submission contains solutions to all the problem for SP1
Solution 1:
    The main file in SortAlgorithmComparator.java(under cs6301.g26 package)
    and all the logic related to the sorting algorithms are placed in cs6301.g26.sorter package
    there are two files.
        1)GenericSorter : Contains logic of Generic merge sort and generic n-squared sort
        2)IntSorter : Contains merge sort implementation for array of type integer.

    Running the program : compile the java files and run the SortAlgorithmComparator, this will ask you
    to enter the size of the array on which you want to compare the sort algorithms. Enter the size and the program
    will output the runtime of each algorithms in milliseconds.


Solution 2:
    The main file in GraphMain.java(under cs6301.g26 package).
    There are 3 files in the graph package,
    1) BFS : This class contains the Breadth First Search util function as well as the function to
             find the diameter of a graph
    2) Cyclic : This class provides a function to find  out  if there is a cycle in the input graph or not.
    3) Graph : The class which is provided in the cs6301 class.

    Running the program : Compile and run the GraphMain class, this will proved 2 options
    1) enter the graph manually
    2) enter the file which contains the graph details.
    User can choose either one of the choice and provide the graph details. Once all the details are entered
    The program will output the diameter of the input graph.
    Note that all the graph inputs should be in the format expected by the graph class readGraph()
    method.
