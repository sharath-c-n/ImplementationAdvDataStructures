The submission contains solutions to all the problem for SP3

Solution 1: The solution file is QuickSort.java and the driver class is SP5Q1Driver.

Solution 2: The solution files are QuickSort.java and the driver class is SP5Q2Driver.

Solution 3: The solution files are QuickSort.java(partition function),BinaryHeap,MinHeap,
MaxHeap,SelectAlgorithm and the driver class is SP5Q3Driver.

Solution 4: The solution file is QuickSort.java (dual pivot) and the driver class is SP5Q4Driver which
contains mergeSort function as well.

solution 5: The solution files are ExternalMergeSort.java and ExternalQuickSort.java and the driver class is ExternalSorting.java.
In solution 4 we have used the merge sort implementation done in SP4 hence the MergeSort file contains all versions
of mergeSort which was implemented.
