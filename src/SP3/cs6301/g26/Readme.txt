The submission contains solutions to all the problem for SP3

Solution 1: The solution file is TopologicalSort, this class contains two kinds of sorting algorithm
            named topologicalSort1 which runs DFS and finds the order and  topologicalSort2
            which Remove vertices with no incoming edges and finds the order.

Solution 2: The solution file is SCC.java (Strongly connected components)

Solution 3: The solution file is Eulerian.java

Solution 4: The solution file is Cyclic.java

Solution 5: The solution file is BridgeCut.java
